	  	<h3 class="lead">Working with Articles</h3>
	  	<p>Folio Author organizes things a bit differently than Adobe’s Online Folio Producer Tools. The biggest change is the introduction of issues. While a folio is a collection of articles, an issue is a grouping of folios. Take for example a company wanting to publish a monthly edition to iPhone, iPad and a few Android devices. An issue would be the “December 2013 Issue” of the publication and inside that issue would be folio renditions for iPhone, iPad, and other devices. Grouping folios by issue allows the grouped folio renditions to share basic metadata that DPS uses to deliver the correct rendition to the targeted device. 
	  	</p>
	  	<p>
	  	Articles also have a hierarchy as well. The first time you create an article it becomes the original article. Whenever you add that article to a rendition, it’s duplicated and added to your rendition, giving the ability to make changes specific that particular rendition. If you ever make a significant change to the original article, you can always push those changes to child articles living in their respective renditions. Below is an example of issue / article / rendition hierarchy. 
	  	</p>
	  	<br />
		<section class="tabs pill">

		    <ul class="tab-nav">
		        <li class="active"><a href="#">Import</a></li>
		        <li> <a href="#">Edit</a></li>
		        <li><a href="#">Preview</a></li>
		        <li><a href="#">Templates</a></li>
		    </ul>

		    <div class="tab-content active">
		        <img src="images/layouts/screenshots.jpg" alt="" />
                <br />
		        <p>You don't have to make articles from scratch. Bring posts into Folio Author Plugin through any custom post type, using any filter option you'd like. Once installed, the plugin adds an option to the filter drop down menu from any post / custom post type page that allows you to select posts to import. There is also an option to associate those posts to an issue you've started. 
		    </div>
		    <div class="tab-content">
		        <img src="images/layouts/screenshots2.jpg" alt="" />
		        <br />
		        <p>
					When adding an article into your folio rendition, an article becomes an article rendition that can be edited specifically for the folio rendition on a specific device. For instance, if you’d like to change a headline to be shorter on a mobile device, you can click on the “edit article” icon on the right side of the article bar and then edit this article rendition without affecting any other renditions of the article.
		        </p>
		        <p>
		        	Once inside of an article, you can begin working on your content. You can select a template for the article to bring in styles. You can also edit the article metadata on the right if you don’t plan to bring in a sidecar.xml to carry that metadata in.
		        </p>
		    </div>
		    <div class="tab-content">
		        <img src="images/layouts/screenshots3.jpg" alt="" />
		        <br />
		        <p>After you've done your edits you can preview directly in your browser before pushing the article to the cloud to preview on your device.</p>
		    </div>
		    <div class="tab-content">
		        <br />
			    <p>
			    	Mercury has provided a basic template for creating articles. You can take these samples and make them your own by copying the dps-templates into your theme folder. From here you can make any changes to these templates to make them your own.

		        <p>Click “create new issue” to bring up the box where you can enter all metadata to be shared among all renditions of that issues: Folio Name, Folio Number, Publication Name/Magazine Title, Folio Description, Publication Date, Cover Date, and Filters. </p>
		    </div>
		    <div class="tab-content">
		        <img src="images/layouts/screenshots5.jpg" alt="" />
		        <br />
		        <p>To the right of an issue, you can create folio renditions by clicking the + New Rendition button. As folios/renditions are specific per device, they hold advanced metadata about device size and have separate cover images for each device. Folios/renditions can all share articles, or, if desired, each folio rendition can hold a unique set of articles for its specific device. It is best to make your first rendition the biggest device you plan to publish to. (This is because you will be adding articles this folio rendition first, then pulling articles into other folio renditions from it for other devices. Smaller devices are likely to require certain articles to be split up or otherwise modified for mobile devices.) </p>
		    </div>
		    <div class="tab-content">
		        <img src="images/layouts/screenshots6.jpg" alt="" />
		        <br />
		        <p>Once articles are locked down they can be imported. Go into a folio rendition and click “add article” to add a rendition of the original article for this device’s folio rendition.</p>
		    </div>
		    <div class="tab-content">
		        <img src="images/layouts/screenshots7.jpg" alt="" />
		        <br />
		        <p>Once everything is ready in a folio rendition, you can push to the cloud by clicking on the “push rendition to the cloud” button that appears next to the folio rendition’s metadata. 
At any time after the folio rendition appears in the cloud, you can push individual article updates or  whole folio updates back to the cloud

    		        Installation steps below:
                    <br />●	Upload 'adobe-folio-author-wp-plugin' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory in your WordPress instance
                    <br />●	Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
                    <br />●	You will now see an icon for Folio Author in your admin menu on the left. From the plugin menu choose `Settings` to set up your credentials and any defaults for the plugin.

		        </p>
		    </div>
		    <div class="tab-content text-left ten columns centered">
		        <p>
					Navigate to settings tab under Folio Producer in the WordPress sidebar to set up Folio Author plugin.
					There are three main sections in the settings page: API Key/Secret entry, Folio Producer account setup and Device List.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Adobe API Key and Secret, DPS Login and Password</strong> <br />
					If you are a DPS Enterprise licensed publisher you can contact your Adobe representative to request a unique Folio Producer API Key and Secret. By enabling the Folio Author module to directly connect to the Folio Producer APIs, publishers can maintain a sync status with all article content published through WordPress. Publishing through the Folio Producer APIs will streamline the WordPress folio publishing workflow by uploading the article content directly to Folio Producer. You will also need to enter the login for the DPS account you wish to publish to, along with the corresponding password.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Presets</strong> <br />
					We include helpful tips on rollover to help get you acquainted with the plugin. You can turn off these tooltips by checking “disable tooltips around the plugin”
					You can also enable “automatically make a TOC preview image” which generates the TOC preview image using the first image in the body content.
					The plugin also allows you to pre-set a default template for new articles you create.
					You can also select an HTMLResources.zip file that will be included with every folio rendition that gets uploaded.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Device List</strong><br />
					The device list holds a preset list of devices. You can select devices to which you will want to publish here, or add new devices by entering name, slug, dimensions, and device type (mobile/tablet), then clicking “add device to list.” The Folio Author plugin allows you to publish to any device that supports Adobe Digital Publishing Suite.

The next step would be to copy the templates-dps folder out of the plugin folder and into your theme folder. This template can then be made your own by editing them and changing styles.
